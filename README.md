The following report has been prepared to demonstrate the value of machine learning models in pop up advertisements for Straits Times Digital. 

## Context
With rising privacy concerns in online advertising worldwide, there have been stricter privacy regulations enforced, leading to Google announcing a ban of 3rd party cookies by the end of 2023. It has instead promised to introduce a private alternative that users and advertisers will be happy with. There is therefore a need for a new solution that can match users to the most appropriate advertisement without the use of cookies. Straits Times, which uses many ad-serving platforms that require the use of cookies to advertise to their users, may now have to rethink ways to better identify which ads are the most suited to which user in order to ensure the same amount of clicks, hence revenue, as before. Additionally, these ad-serving platforms usually take up a larger portion of the revenue earned from the clicks on the advertisements. As a result, there exists an opportunity for Straits Times to innovate new ways to earn higher revenue without relying on such ad-serving platforms. 

The objective for our porject is thus, to increase the click through rate (number of times an advertisement was clicked/number of times an advertisement was viewed) so as to increase revenue for Straits Times through increased commission fees. Furthermore, a first party predictive model will allow Straits Times to no longer rely on third party providers to take a cut of the commission fee. This report will present our research, analysis, action plans and detailed descriptions of how we intend to increase the click through rate using various machine learning models. 

## Types of Machine Learning Model Used:

1. Association Rules 
2. Logistic Regression with Backwards Elimination 
3. Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
4. Random Forest 
5. Neural Network with Hyperparameter Tuning 
6. XGBoost 

*All the machine learning models were trained on both an unbalanced and balanced dataset and the results were compared against each other*
